# Contributing to Open Pixel Art

There are two ways you can contribute to this project. You can either contribute a single pixel to the canvas or you can contribute to the underlying project. For example by adding tests, updating the HTML template or updating documentation.

For both scenarios the setup is the same, however, the contribution steps differ slightly.
